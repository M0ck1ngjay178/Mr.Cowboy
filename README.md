## üìè **Rules**  
- Players may double jump only when on the ground, not while on a platform.  
- Falling or walking off a platform prevents landing on one below.  
- Platforms are for going higher, not lower.  
- Players can walk off one side of the screen and reappear on the other side. Dynamite follows this rule, but bullets do not.  
- After a certain amount of time:  
    - Platform speed will continuously change.  
    - Enemy speeds will increase infinitely.  
    - 2 new enemies will spawn for a total of 4 enemies.
